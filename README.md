# **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**

This is my first Full project that covers only the basics of object oriented programming written in C++.  

It's a simple console app implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.  

## Key features

- You can play against a friend or against a bot.
- You can choose to either play 3 , 5 , or 7 rounds.
- In case the game ended with a tie, there's a sudden death mode theat won't leave the game unless there's a winner.
- When the game's over, there's a full sccoreboard of each player's move in every round.

## Technologies Used 
- **C++** – The core language used for development.
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** – Implemented using classes and inheritance.
- **CLion (JetBrains)** – IDE for writing and debugging C++ code.
- **CMake** – Build system generator for compiling the project.
- **STL (Standard Template Library)** – Used `vector` for managing game data.
- **Git & GitHub** – For version control and project collaboration.

## Project Structure

- `Game.cpp`       ─ Core game logic implementation  
- `Game.h`         ─ Class definitions and declarations  
- `main.cpp`       ─ Program entry point  
- `CMakeLists.txt` ─ Build configuration for CMake  
- `README.md`      ─ Project documentation
